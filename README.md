# Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Analysis in India (2001 - 2024)

### Introduction
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market in India from 2001 to 2024. With the increasing adoption of electric mobility as a sustainable solution, understanding the trends and patterns of EV manufacturing and adoption is crucial. This analysis provides insights into the rise of EV manufacturing hubs, popular manufacturers, and the distribution of public charging infrastructure across Indian states.

### Key Objectives:
* Analyze the growth of EV manufacturing from 2001 to 2024.<br/>
* Identify leading states and cities contributing to EV manufacturing.<br/>
* Exploring the top EV manufacturers and their vehicle categories.<br/>
* Understanding the distribution of public charging stations (PCS) across states.<br/>

### Data Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, containing detailed information about EV manufacturing trends, state-wise PCS distribution, and vehicle category breakdowns from 2001 to 2024.<br/><br/>

### Insights and Conclusion

##### Leading Manufacturing States
Maharashtra leads India's EV manufacturing with 15 manufacturers, followed by Tamil Nadu with 11. Karnataka and Haryana have 6 each, driven by Bengaluru's startup ecosystem and Haryana's automobile base. Gujarat (5), Delhi (4), and Rajasthan (4) are emerging hubs for EV production. Other states like Telangana, West Bengal, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Punjab are growing in EV manufacturing. <br/><br/>

##### Charging Infrastructure
Maharashtra leads the EV charging infrastructure race, followed by Delhi & Karnataka.
Top 5 states account for nearly 75% of all charging stations and others states like Lakshadweep, Daman & Diu, and Nagaland lack sufficient PCS, limiting EV adoption.

##### Vehicle category dominance
Two-wheelers dominate Indian transportation due to their affordability and convenience. Light Motor Vehicles (LMV) show a rise in private vehicle ownership. Electric two-wheelers and small commercial vehicles are gaining traction. Future focus should be on enhancing public transport, EV adoption, and optimizing infrastructure for all vehicle categories.

##### EV Sales Trend (2015-2024)
Steady Growth (2015-2019): Gradual increase in EV sales but remained relatively low.
Sharp Surge (2020 Onward): Significant rise in sales due to better policies, infrastructure, and adoption.
Peak in Recent Years (2023-2024): Highest sales recorded, reflecting rapid market expansion and increased EV adoption.
